## Image Path Reference

The image is referenced in the code as:
```javascript
image: '/images/team/youba-simao-thiam.jpg'
```

This means the file should be at:
```
/public/images/team/youba-simao-thiam.jpg
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Check the file name matches exactly: `youba-simao-thiam.jpg`

3. Check file permissions
4. Refresh the browser (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
