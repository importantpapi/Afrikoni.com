# AFRIKONI: The Connective Tissue of African Commerce 🌍🔥

> **One Flow. 54 Markets. Zero Friction.**

Afrikoni is the **Trade Operating System** that makes African cross-border commerce as fast, cheap, and trustworthy as buying from your neighbor.

## 🚀 The Vision
Imagine a Nigerian manufacturer needs cocoa from Ghana. Today, it takes **20 days, costs 12% in fees, and has a 25% fraud risk**.

Afrikoni turns that into: **14 days, 5% fees, 0% fraud** — all while generating a digital credit score that helps traders access bank loans.

We are what Alibaba would build if it understood Africa's real constraints: expensive data, unreliable electricity, border complexity, and chronic lack of trust.

## 🏗️ The "One Flow" Architecture

Afrikoni orchestrates trade through four sovereign layers:

### 🛂 1. Identity (The Passport)
Every trader gets a government-verified **Digital Passport** using Smile ID and local registration sinks. Banks and customs trust this identity, enabling faster approvals.

### ⚖️ 2. Law (The Smart Contract)
AI-generated contracts that automatically inject **AfCFTA Rules of Origin** clauses and HS code classification. We turn legal complexity into deterministic code.

### 💰 3. Money (The Rail)
A **Corridor Optimizer** that settles trades in local currencies (Naira, Shillings, etc.) via PAPSS and mobile money rails, bypassing the need for expensive USD conversions.

### 🔍 4. Trust (The DNA Index)
A real-time **Trust DNA Index** that mutates as traders complete milestones. This creates an immutable forensic audit trail that banks use as collateral for trade finance.
