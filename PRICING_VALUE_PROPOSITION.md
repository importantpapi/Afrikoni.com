## 🎯 YOUR SALES PITCH

### 30-Second Pitch:

"Hi [Name], I'm from Afrikoni - we're a B2B marketplace connecting buyers with verified African suppliers. What makes us different is our pricing: we only charge a success fee when a deal actually closes - typically 5-10% of the order value. No upfront costs, no listing fees, no risk to try. We only make money when you do. Would you like to see how it works?"

### Objection Handling:

**"How much is the fee?"**
- "Typically 5-10% of order value, but we can discuss based on your volume. The key is it's only charged when the deal closes."

**"What if no deals close?"**
- "Then you pay nothing. That's the beauty - no risk. We're incentivized to help you succeed."

**"That's expensive."**
- "Consider the alternative: spending hours searching for suppliers, vetting them, negotiating, handling payments. We do all of that for you, and you only pay if it works. Plus, we provide escrow protection and verified suppliers."
