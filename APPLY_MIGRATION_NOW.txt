🚀 APPLY MIGRATION NOW - QUICK STEPS

I've prepared everything for you:

✅ SQL Editor opened in your browser
✅ Migration SQL copied to your clipboard

NEXT STEPS (30 seconds):

1. In the SQL Editor that just opened:
   - Paste the SQL (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for: "Success. No rows returned."

2. Then verify:
   npm run check-all

That's it! Migration will be applied and system will be ready.
