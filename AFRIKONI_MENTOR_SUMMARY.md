# AFRIKONI
## AI-Powered Pan-African Trade Infrastructure Platform

### Executive Summary & Business Plan for Mentors

---

**Founder:** Solo Founder | Brussels, Belgium
**Date:** January 2026
**Stage:** Pre-Launch (95% Built)
**Seeking:** €100,000 - €115,000

---

## WHAT IS AFRIKONI?

**One sentence:** Afrikoni is the Stripe of African trade—an AI-powered infrastructure platform that enables verified B2B commerce across all 54 African countries.

**The longer version:** Afrikoni is a Trade Operating System (Trade OS) that provides the foundational rails—verification, payments, logistics, compliance, and intelligence—upon which African cross-border trade operates. The marketplace interface is just the application layer. Beneath it lies AI-driven trust scoring, trade matching algorithms, risk engines, and logistics optimization.

### What We're NOT
- We're NOT just another marketplace like Alibaba or Jumia
- We're NOT competing on listings or products
- We're NOT a simple buyer-seller connector

### What We ARE
- Trade infrastructure (like Stripe is for payments)
- A trust layer for African commerce
- An AI-powered intelligence platform
- The operating system for Pan-African B2B trade

---

## THE PROBLEM

### African Trade is Broken

**The numbers:**
- African intra-continental trade is only **15%** of total African trade (vs 60% in Europe, 40% in Asia)
- **$50+ billion lost annually** to trade friction
- **73%** of businesses cite "supplier trust" as #1 barrier
- **42 different currencies** across the continent
- **7-21 days** average customs clearance
- **30%+** of shipments delayed by documentation errors

### Why This Happens

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Trust Deficit** | No way to verify if a supplier is legitimate |
| **Payment Risk** | No escrow protection, 6-15% wire transfer fees |
| **Logistics Chaos** | No visibility, no tracking, customs nightmares |
| **Information Asymmetry** | Can't verify quality, capacity, or fair pricing |

### The Gap

While Stripe provides payment infrastructure for the internet, Flexport provides logistics infrastructure for global trade, and Plaid provides data infrastructure for fintech—**no platform provides trade infrastructure for Africa**.

This isn't a marketplace problem. It's an **infrastructure problem**.

### The Five AI Intelligence Engines

| Engine | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Supplier Intelligence** | Dynamic trust scores, fraud detection, capacity prediction | Turns verification from binary to intelligent |
| **Trade Matching** | RFQ optimization, price intelligence, demand-supply matching | Better matches = more trade = more data |
| **Risk & Compliance** | AML monitoring, sanctions screening, document verification | Regulatory moat across 54 jurisdictions |
| **Logistics Optimization** | Route optimization, delay prediction, carrier matching | 15-30% cost reduction, faster delivery |
| **Market Intelligence** | Trade flow analytics, demand forecasting, pricing trends | Proprietary data product |

### The Data Flywheel

```
More Trade → More Data → Better AI → Better Matching → More Trade
     ↑                                                      │
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

RESULT: Compounding advantage that grows with each transaction

## FOUNDER PROFILE

### Background

- **Solo founder** based in Brussels, Belgium
- **Full-stack developer** - built entire platform alone
- **Capital efficient** - €250K+ platform built with €0 funding
- **Determined** - built on a broken laptop, no resources

### The Founder Story

> "I built a €250,000 B2B trade platform on a broken laptop with zero funding. I'm not looking for money to build a product—I'm looking for money to launch one that already exists."

### Why This Founder Will Win

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Execution** | 38,000+ lines of production code, working platform |
| **Capital Efficiency** | Built €250K value with €0 |
| **Technical** | Can iterate without expensive dev team |
| **Hunger** | Nothing to lose, everything to gain |
| **Speed** | Solo decision-making, no bureaucracy |

### Support Needed

| Type | Ask |
|------|-----|
| **Funding** | €100K to launch and operate 18 months |
| **Mentorship** | African trade/logistics expertise |
| **Network** | Introductions to African trade associations |
| **Accountability** | Regular check-ins and guidance |

---

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Slow adoption** | Medium | Supply-side first strategy; suppliers bring buyers |
| **Payment integration delay** | Medium | Manual escrow backup; builds more trust initially |
| **Competition** | Medium | Move fast; infrastructure advantages compound |
| **Founder burnout** | High | Weekly day off, support network, health first |
| **Regulatory issues** | Low | KYC/AML built-in; local legal counsel |
| **Running out of money** | Medium | 18-month runway; revenue focus from month 4 |

### Contingency Plans

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Payment takes too long | Launch with manual escrow (wire transfers) |
| Adoption is slow | Pivot to "verification as a service" for other platforms |
| Need more money | Revenue-based financing, accelerators, African angels |
| Competitive threat | Double down on data moat and AI intelligence |

---

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Success Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Key Metric | Target |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** (M1-3) | Platform completion | 100%, payments live |
| **Phase 2** (M4-6) | Network participants | 150 (100 sellers, 50 buyers) |
| **Phase 3** (M7-12) | Verified suppliers | 500+ |
| **Phase 4** (M13-18) | Monthly GMV | $500,000 |
| **Year 1** | Total GMV | $1,000,000 |
| **Year 1** | Revenue | $234,000 |
| **Year 1** | Break-even | Achieved by Month 12-15 |

### Daily Metrics

```
Growth:        New suppliers, new buyers, active users
Trade Flows:   RFQs created, quotes sent, orders placed, GMV
Quality:       Dispute rate, trust scores, support tickets
Financial:     Revenue, runway remaining
```

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

### The Three Truths

1. **The platform is built.** 95% complete. Most startups fail before having a product. We have infrastructure.

2. **The market is ready.** AfCFTA is live. Digital adoption is accelerating. The timing is perfect.

3. **No one else is doing this.** There's no Stripe for African trade. We're building it.

### The Opportunity

> "Africa is the last great frontier of global commerce. The continent that gave humanity its beginning will define the 21st century economy. Afrikoni is building the infrastructure to make that happen."
