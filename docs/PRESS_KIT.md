## THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

### African Trade is Broken

Africa's intra-continental trade represents only **15% of total African trade** - compared to 60% in Europe and 40% in Asia. This isn't because African businesses don't want to trade with each other. It's because they **can't trust each other**.

**The barriers:**
- No centralized platform for verified supplier discovery
- Payment fraud and non-delivery risks
- Complex customs and logistics across 54 countries
- 42 different currencies with expensive conversion
- No dispute resolution mechanisms

**The cost:**
- African businesses lose **$50+ billion annually** to trade friction
- Small businesses are locked out of cross-border opportunities
- Economic growth is stunted by fragmentation

### Our Solution

Afrikoni creates the **trust infrastructure** that enables seamless African B2B trade:

1. **Verified Suppliers** - KYC/KYB verification for every business
2. **Protected Payments** - Escrow holds funds until delivery is confirmed
3. **Integrated Logistics** - Track shipments and customs in real-time
4. **Dispute Resolution** - Fair arbitration when issues arise
5. **One Platform** - 54 countries, one marketplace

## FOUNDER STORY

### Built with Nothing. Built to Last.

Afrikoni was built by a solo founder with **€0 in funding** and a **broken laptop**.

> "I saw African businesses struggling to trust each other across borders. Payment fraud, fake suppliers, shipments that never arrived. I knew technology could solve this, but no one was building it. So I did."

**In 12 months, the founder:**
- Wrote 38,000+ lines of production code
- Designed 43 database migrations
- Built 210 React components
- Created a platform valued at €250,000-€350,000

**The thesis:** If one person with no resources can build this much, imagine what's possible with actual support.
