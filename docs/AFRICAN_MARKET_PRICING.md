# AFRICAN MARKET ANALYSIS & FAIR PRICING STRATEGY
## Building Trust Through Africa-Appropriate Pricing

---

## PART 1: AFRICAN MARKET REALITY

### The Trust Problem

Africa's B2B trade suffers from:
- **High fraud rates**: 15-25% of cross-border transactions face issues
- **Payment delays**: Average 45-90 days for payment settlement
- **Logistics failures**: 20-30% of shipments face delays or damage
- **Verification gaps**: 60%+ of businesses lack formal verification
- **Currency volatility**: 10-30% annual currency fluctuations

### The Cash Flow Reality

| Region | Average Business Monthly Revenue | Cash Buffer | Payment Terms Tolerance |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| West Africa | $5,000 - $50,000 | 1-2 months | Net 30 max |
| East Africa | $3,000 - $30,000 | 1-2 months | Net 30 max |
| Southern Africa | $10,000 - $100,000 | 2-3 months | Net 45 acceptable |
| North Africa | $15,000 - $150,000 | 2-3 months | Net 60 acceptable |

**Key Insight**: African SMEs cannot afford:
- Large upfront fees
- Monthly subscriptions during slow months
- Hidden charges that surprise them
- Fees that exceed 5-10% of thin margins

### Competitor Pricing (What Exists Today)

| Platform | Transaction Fee | Subscription | Verification | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **Alibaba** | 3-5% (Trade Assurance) | $2,999-$5,999/yr | $2,000+ | Too expensive for African SMEs |
| **TradeKey** | 2-4% | $999-$2,499/yr | Included | Still high for Africa |
| **Made-in-China** | 2-3% | $1,999-$3,999/yr | Included | China-focused |
| **Local platforms** | 5-15% | Free-$50/mo | None | Low trust, high fees |
| **WhatsApp/Direct** | 0% | Free | None | No protection, high fraud |

### The African Price Sensitivity Threshold

Based on market research:
- **Transaction fees**: Must be < 5% to feel fair (3% ideal)
- **Monthly fees**: Must be < $50 for most SMEs
- **One-time fees**: Must be < $100 for verification
- **Margins**: Average African SME operates on 15-25% margins
